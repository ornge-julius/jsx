"May 20, 2025",SPY,PUT,Win,SPY 592 PUT 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,1.47,1.65(2x),40,"May 20, 2025",I took this trade after immediately closing my last one. This was a position reversal. I was confident in this after noticing how price broke back into ORB earlier in the session. I did not wait for a confirmation candle in this one since i was pretty confident in price action. I fully accepted risk (it was low once again) and took the trade. Waited for price to hit my full TP and got out. It’s worth noting that there was an ORB break to the downside after this. I was actually a great setup but i was scared to take it. Risk was much bigger an i was scared of losing the small profits i secured on the day. I feel as though i should have still taken the trade because it was an even better setup than this one it was just that risk was bigger since my entry was far from ORB. Price ended up dumping and i missed out on a huge trade.
"May 20, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 595 CALL 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,1.49(2x),1.37(2x),-24,"May 20, 2025",Took this after ORB broke to the upside. Wasn’t the most confident since i noticed the price broke ORB and immediately reversed earlier in the day. Im starting to really notice how price reacts to ORB rather than just blindly taking trades after they break ORB. Risk was low so it made me a little more comfortable taking the trade. Ultimately price broke back into ORB and i closed the position. I had a feeling it would do this though given how it reacted to ORB earlier in the day.
"May 19, 2025",SPY,CALL,Win,SPY 593 CALL 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,1.81 (2x),2.17,71,"May 19, 2025","Good trade, waited for my setup. Took the trade and accepted the risk. This is my first trade after studying “Trading in the Zone” concepts. I am learning to think in a mindset of probabilities and not a deterministic mindset. I need to under stand that i cannot expect or predict what the market will do. All i can do is execute my trading plan and accept my defined risk. The only downside to this trade was i did get some fear of losing money. Price move in my direction but began to breifly reverse. I set a trailing stop as to lock in profits but i think this may have been done out of fear of losing. I am trying to evaluate whether me setting traling stops is a good thing as i lock in profits but i also limit the changes of hitting my full R/R of 2:1. In this case i got stopped out only for price to chop and then continue and hit my full TP."
"May 15, 2025",SPY,CALL,Win,SPY 590 CALL 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,2.87,3.20,33,"May 15, 2025","This was accidental, was not paying attention and bought calls instead of puts. Luckly didn’t lose money."
"May 15, 2025",SPY,PUT,Loss,SPY 590 PUT 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,1.50 (2x),1.22,-56.65,"May 15, 2025",I took this trade right before Stef engaged me in a deep conversation. I shoudl’ve just not traded on my day off when i knew i was supposed to be spending time with her. I was half keeping an eye on the trade while trying to talk to her. I ended up stopping out quickly so i could continue the conversation. Soon as a got out price dumped and i missed out. I would’ve stayed in had i not bee distracted. Need to make sure I’m only trading when i can have focus on the charts.
"May 14, 2025",SPY,CALL,Win,SPY 587 CALL 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,1.73(2x),2.05(2x),64,"May 13, 2025","Trying some new things with this  one. I used ChatGPT to teach me about the Greeks, specifically delta and gamma. I realized that trading 4dtes was not optimal and also trading OTM calls was also not optimal. Now I’m switching to 1dte or possibly 0dte. I took this wil confidence since we had good inflation data and also price broke out of ORB with rising volume. I wasn;t the most disciplined when taking profit but i just wanted to lock in a quick win after taking so many losses. Market ended up ripping and I could’ve stayed in much longer."
"May 8, 2025",SPY,PUT,Loss,SPY 559 PUT 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.00,2.66,-34,"May 8, 2025","I was already kinda pissed when i entered this trade. Price broke back out of ORB, i waited for candle closure then entered to the downside. This trade was actually in profit about 18-20% and had hit a R/R of 2.91/1. I should’ve taken profit but i wanted to see if i could fully recover my losses on the day. Well i should’ve gotten out on the wick at TP because price then reversed on the biggest fucking green candle i’ve ever seen and i stopped out. I shoudl’ve just taken profit and only had a small $20 loss on the day. But now im sitting with more than $120 in losses because i was not disciplined and did not take profit when i hit my TP."
"May 8, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 568 CALL 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.25,2.89,-36,"May 8, 2025","Price broke back into ORB, i waited for candle closer then entered. Price then continued up for one candle and then reversed back out of ORB. I got chopped up this morning and i was really frustrated after this trade. I am trying to stick to ORB but price never continues and always reverses after i get into a trade. This is incredibly frustrating and leads me to feeling high emotions and feeling angry."
"May 8, 2025",SPY,PUT,Loss,SPY 559 PUT 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.37,2.79,-58,"May 8, 2025","Saw a Break an retest then entered off the second break of ORB. Price continued down for one candle then reversed back into ORB and i stopped out. ALso lost more than i wanted to on this one. Don’t want to lose close to $60 on one trade, think i need to learn more about which contracts to choose because I’m only choosing them based on strike price and premium price. But some seem more volatile than others. I expected to lose closer to $30 on this trade."
"May 7, 2025",SPY,PUT,Loss,SPY 554 PUT 2DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,2.77,2.35,-42,"May 7, 2025",Got in after price reversed and broke the downside of ORB. Saw a restest and then a continuation candle then entered. I actually bought the middle of the candle and not the candle close (FOMO). Need to work on FOMO and being patient on the entry. But followed my plan and just got stopped out as price chopped around. The only thing i think i cna learn is maybe use volume as confirmation a bit more even though this was a low volume day. There were some other ORB opportunities on other tickers but trying to just stick to SPY. Not sure if it’s worth me looking at other tickers though because AMZN and META had great ORB setups today.
"May 6, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 563 CALL 3 DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.22,3.13,-9,"May 6, 2025",Was my first entry but got stopped out accidentally when trying to set a STOP order but it got filled as a LIMIT order. This is the second time this happened. I need to pay attention to what I’m doing when placing my stop loss. But this was actually a blessing because i ended up with a better second entry and ended up with a huge profit.
"May 6, 2025",SPY,CALL,Win,SPY 563 CALL 3DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.07,4.38,131,"May 6, 2025","Great trade, a little lucky on this one, but i consider this making my own luck. I entered this after a break to the upside of ORB. Waited for a continuation candle and took the trade. this is actually a second entry because i once again got accidentally stopped out of my first entry trying to set my stop loss. This trade tested my patience and psychology. It took awhile but ran up to a 1/1 R/R. I wanted to be patient and see if it could hit 2/1 but of course price sharply decline and i was at break even. It chopped around break even for awhile but i didn’t immediately close the trade then out of nowhere ah huge spike in volume happened and price completely skyrocketed in a big bullish candle. It blew right past my TP and i got out. I couldn’t find what caused it or anything just considered it lucky and got out. Good thing i got out when I did because price came right back down. lesson learned here is always follow the plan, because you never may know what will happen. Could get lucky."
"May 7, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 566 CALL 2DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,2.68,2.30,-38,"May 7, 2025","Overall this was a choppy day also had big data (FOMC) in the afternoon so not much volume. Decided to still trade but just sized down. I followed my plan here and waited for a break of ORB and a retest then got in. Price wicked off the top of ORB a total of 5 times, 3 of which came after i entered the trade. The candles were just wicking around and not moving much on price then price dumped back into ORB and i stopped out."
"May 5, 2025",SPY,PUT,Loss,SPY 563 PUT 2DTE,5 Minute Chart,Double Top,3.32,3.17,-15,"May 5, 2025",This was a dubm trade that had nothing to do with my trading plan. I took this because i freak out when price made a double top at a level of resistance while i was in calls. I had not business taking this trade because my thesis on calls was not invalidated because price had not broken back into ORB. Price wasn’t even close to doing that. Stick to the plan. Do not exit trades or enter a new trade until price has broken back into ORB.
"May 5, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 568 CALL 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.77,3.66,-11,"May 5, 2025",This was the correct entry for the day. Price finally broke out of the chop and continued up our of ORB. This entry had alot more risk since the candle closed so far from ORB. My lesson on this is when a candle closes thsi far from ORB then just size down. I instead took a full size which would have been fine had i stayed in the trade because it was ultimately a winner…had i held like i was supposed to. But if i sized down it would help with my psychology. But also i needed to hold this trade. I freaked out when i saw price form a double top at a level of resistance. I then got out of the trade and took a short which is not part of my trading plan at all. This ended up pulling back slightly then continuing up the rest of the day. I let my emotions get the best of my and tried to justify it with price action. I am only invalidated when price break back into ORB. That i the only time i should exit a trade before I am in profit!!
"May 5, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 569 CALL 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,"3.23, 3.11",2.90 (2x),-56,"May 5, 2025","Lesson learned on this one. I followed my entry rules but price began to break back into ORB. I was overly confident but also a little panicked so i took a second entry only for price to hit my stop. I am not advanced enough to be taking second entries and also I ended up losing more than i should have. So i lacked discipline here. Funny thing is price ended up going up like i was betting but i was not patient enough. I need to follow my rules to the T. Do not deviate!!! Follow the plan. But i think my patience on entry was better. I waited for a double re-test and then got in the trade. Needed to not take that second entry though, that is what messed my up. Ultimately though i got caught in chop before the actual move happened."
"May 2, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 567 CALL 3DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,2.46,2.19,-27,"May 2, 2025",This was sort of a revenge trade. I was a little flustered after accidentally being stopped out of my great entry at the beginning of the morning. Looking back i can also see i broke a rule and a bought in the middle of a candle forming and not a candle closure. I saw a break and retest of ORB and i took it but price moved against me and i stopped out. I was never super confident in this once since price had been chopping and also not feeling great after my first stop out. Should have probably not taken this one or waited for a better entry or setup.
"May 2, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 565 CALL 3DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,,2.28,-9,"May 2, 2025",This was me trying to re enter the trade I accidentally got stopped out of. This ended up being a mess and I didn’t win because it was late entry into the move. Was just trying to chase since I got stopped out of my original entry. Should've probably just cut my losses and waited for a new setup.
"May 2, 2025",SPY,CALL,Win,SPY 565 CALL 3DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.09,3.18,9,"May 2, 2025",This was a great entry. Price broke back into the bottom of ORB and I took the trade. But I freaking made a mistake and set a limit order rather than an atop order for my stop loss. The order executed and I was out of the trade completely by accident. Had this not happened I would’ve made bank. Frustrated by this!
"May 1, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 566 CALL 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,2.95,2.67,-28,"May 1, 2025",This was another good trade but wasn’t as confident. I think the real trade for the day was the first trade I took of the day which ended up losing. I took this when I saw price break back into ORB for a double bottom(ish) and then reverse out of ORB to the upside. I got in after a confirmation candle. Ultimately price went against my again and I got out soon as price broke back into ORB. Nothing really to report on this one just another L though it was not very big because I sized down since ORB was smaller and I expected things to be a bit choppy.
"May 1, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 568 CALL 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,2.57,2.56,-1,"May 1, 2025","This trade was going well, opening range (OR) was a bit small today so I didn’t go full sized. But this trade was going well, was about 70% to TP and then price reversed. I was well into profit and was considering just closing out before TP but I wanted to stay disciplined and I used my entry as my stop loss. Ended up losing only $1 because I got a good entry and risk was low. Did a good job following my rules and saved myself from losing a lot more money. But this trade did make me consider using a trailing stop epecially when I’m so close to TP. I asked ChatGPT for advice on this and I think I will try it out. It seems like my profits may suffer a little but my win rate would also increase so it seems like kind of a trade off but I do think it is something I want to implement. Overall good trade."
"April 30, 2025",SPY,CALL,Win,SPY 553 CALL 3DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.50,4.19,69,"April 30, 2025","Wow, good trade. Was patient and waited for price to close outside of ORB. But the real play today was taking the break inside of the bottom ORB level and trading inside of ORB. ORB was huge and market had bearish sentiment overnight but bounced at the bottom ORB level. I did not take that trade but waited for price to break above the top ORB level and got in. This was my longest held trade and i almost got wicked out twice. Price finally went my direction and i hit my TP. My wife inadvertently caused me to not stop out since we were having an important convo at the time, but i had my max stop loss in play just in case anything happened and i couldn’t close the trade in time by myself. This one felt good because of how long i had to wait and how I had to fight some emotions from prematurely stopping myself out."
"April 29, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 559 CALL 3DTE,5 Minute Chart,"Break of resistance ",3.01,2.93,-7,"April 29, 2025",Really had no business getting into this one. Was not a part of ORB. Was really a continuation of my winning trade on the day. I ultimately felt like I should’ve held my winner longer but I sold when it was wicking off of resistance. I got into this after price broke resistance and it ended up reversing but my risk was small and I took a small L. But I should have never gotten into this and I broke part of my trading rules.
"April 29, 2025",SPY,CALL,Win,SPY 556 CALL 3DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.59,4.00,41,"April 29, 2025",This trade had a high prob setup along with ORB. Price formed a pin bar off a level of support after falling back into ORB. I waited for a bullish reversal candle after the pin bar for confirmation. The bullish candle also broke ORB and I entered the trade. I hit my 2/1 RR. Waited a bit to see how price would react to a level of resistance it was touching. I got out since price seemed to be wicking off the resistance level. In hindsight I could’ve held as price ended up breaking the level and briefly continuing.
"April 29, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 557 CALL 3DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.73,3.04,-69,"April 29, 2025",Entered this after a large wick into ORB. I saw this as a retest of ORB and decided to enter. Price ended up moving against me on this one before I could hit my 2/1 R/R
"April 28, 2025",SPY,PUT,Win,SPY 542 PUTS 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.37,4.65,128,"April 28, 2025","This was a great trade, probably my best trade this year as far as execution. Definitely my best day trade of the year. I was patient with this one as price was chopping around the bottom ORB level. I waited for a solid confirmation, which happened when a noticed an inverse hammer wicked off the bottom ORB level.I got in on the close of the candle and SPY flushed from there. I achieved about a 4:1 R/R on this trade. I was confident and calm, did not feel too emotional since my risk was small and I got a good entry. Feeling a little more confident in this strategy as long as I am using at least a 2:1 R/R and I understand that this is about a 50% win rate strategy from my backtesting. So for every winner I need to expect there will be a loser but so long as my wins are at least twice as big as my losses I should be profitable."
"April 25, 2025",SPY,CALL,Win,SPY 551 CALL 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.27,4.34,107,"April 25, 2025","Very proud of this trade. Waited for my setup, brice broke and retested then i got in. Held through some wicks, but remained calm. It also helped that i was mainly focused on something else and not watching the trade the whole way. I need to make sure with the strategy i keep following the 2:1 risk to reward ratio since i believe the strategy has about a 50% win rate."
"April 25, 2025",SPY,PUT,Loss,SPY 529 PUT 4 DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.29,2.73,-56,"April 25, 2025","entered short after breakout and confirmation candle. Price ended up going against me and i got out as soon as price closed above ORB. This was a good trade, i followed my trading plan and didn’t lose much capital. Looking back this was actually the bad trade. The “confirmation candle” was actually a green candle that wicked off a level of support. This was not a continuation candle that I am supposed to be looking for. "
"April 24, 2025",SPY,CALL,Win,SPY 545 CALL 4DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.08,3.67,59,"April 24, 2025","This was a simple break of ORB to the upside. I saw a strong breakout and waited for a confirmation candle then go it. I was confident because price also broke above a key level i had marked. I tried to remain calm and breathe throughout the trade. One thing that did help me was i didn;t look at the chart the whole time. I think this might be how i can deal with my emotions and it’s why i find swing trading so much better. Because i dont have to be looking at the chart the whole trade. I can take the same approach here, i can just set my alerts for my TP and SL and then go on about my day. It’s much more stressful looking at the trade. I’m either going to be right or be wrong and i might as well wait for the market to tell me when it’s time rather than just watching the whole trade. I think from now in i am just going to set alerts on ORB lines and then wait for the alerts to hit and then from there decided to enter a trade and then set alerts for my TP and SL and then go on about my day."
"April 23, 2025",SPY,PUT,Win,SPY 535 PUT 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.63,4.29,66,"April 23, 2025",This was sort of a re-entry of my pervious trade although i didn’t even look at it that way. I saw price retest ORB and reject. I waited for the candle to close and i got in. My hypothesis was right as price continued down through the next support level. I could’ve held longer but didn’t want to risk losing profit. I’m starting to see how big my emotions are. I’m starting to have accurate readings on price but any little pullback freaks me out. Also i exit trades pretty early since I’m afraid the market will take away my gains.
"April 23, 2025",SPY,PUT,Loss,SPY 534 PUT 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.24,2.71,-53,"April 23, 2025",I got into this because it broke ORB and also broke a support level at 539.44. This should not have been a loss because my hypothesis was right. Price ended up retracing back to retest ORB and I got out. I saw how volitale the contracts are (1DTE) and how fast it was moving against me. I had given up all my profit from my first trade and i freaked out. But Had i held i could’ve hade a winning trade because not shortly after price continued down. But I did get back in on a re entry in my next trade and ended up winning.
"April 23, 2025",SPY,PUT,Win,SPY 539 PUT 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,2.99,3.55,56,"April 23, 2025",I saw price reject off the top of ORB and also fall below a support line at 544.05. It then closed below the 9ema and i took the trade thinking that SPY would fall to the lower ORB. I was correct it fell all the way to the bottom ORB and even continued down to the next support level I had drawn. I got out at around 14% profit because there was a freaky candle with large wicks up and down likely related to news. I got spooked and wanted to lock in profits.
"April 22, 2025",GOOGL,CALL,Win,GOOGL 155 CALL,Ari (HD),Day Trade,2.71,2.72,1,"April 22, 2025",Ari called this after the market had a nice pullback in the afternoon. I was a little hesitant to get in nice I did not see a reversal on the charts. I waited for some sort of reversal and got in. The contracts didn’t move very well and I got out with Ari. I felt as though I shoudl’ve stayed in though and I should have. Google ended up flying. Just needed to be more patient. I had a good entry and didn’t have a lot of risk but was a little more scared to lose money.
"April 21, 2025",SPY,PUT,Win,SPY 515 P 22 APR 25,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.08,3.52,44,"April 21, 2025",This one was really easy and simple. SPY was down overnight and as expected had bullish movement in the first 15 minutes. I waited for ORBL to break and got in. I could’ve held this much longer for a much bigger win since SPY completely dumped today and I caught the trend early but just wanted to take quick profits at 14%.
"April 17, 2025",NVDA,PUT,Win,NVDA 100 Put,5 Minute Chart,ORB,2.57,2.85,28,"April 17, 2025",This was my first win with ORB. I saw SPY was flushing and NVDA was weak against the market. It broke the downside of orb. I waited for a confirmation candle the entered. I got out quickly at around 10% since. I could’ve held as this kept going. Should’ve looked for a reversal in the candles but just wanted to secure a win even if it was small
"April 17, 2025",MSFT,CALL,Loss,MSFT 372.5 CALL,Rav (HD),Day Trade,2.09,1.44,-65,"April 17, 2025",This was a second entry on Rav’s call after I got out the first time. I saw price maybe reversing so I got back in on a better entry than the first. This was never really green then SPY flushed and this went with it. Just got out and cut my losses. Really not confident in trying to follow the admin’s signals. You have to get the same entry as them or you’re not going to get nearly the same results.

"April 16, 2025",SPY,PUT,Loss,SPY 527 PUT,5 Minute Chart,ORB,3.36,2.64,-72,"April 16, 2025",This was a revenge trade. I was fed up with the calls from the HD admins and I decided to just take an ORB breakout. It was a break and retest of the bottom ORB. Well that ended up not working either and I lost more money. Price ended up forming a double bottom and broke back into ORB.  I need to learn that the calls from the admins are not meant to be huge wins. I had FOMO when I saw them getting big 30-40% wins when I didn’t have a day trading account. But now that I have one I’m starting to see that this is not easy. I need to focus on getting in and out quick with my 10-15%.

Still trying to learn when to take profit with these trades. But they did signal they were trimming at around 12% and i also had a better entry than both Mike and Brett. Just got greedy i guess.

"May 21, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 592 CALL 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,1.71(2x),1.55(2x),-38,"May 21, 2025",Got in after a break of ORB and continuation. Small risk so it was easy to accept. Got out as soon as price closed into ORB. I had me stop set a few cents inside of ORB and it got hit. Literally the next candle hit my TP. I got whipsawed. IDK what i should be really setting my stop to but this was frustrating.
"May 21, 2025",SPY,CALL,Loss,SPY 593 CALL 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,1.41(2x),1.09(2x),-64,"May 21, 2025",Entered after price broke ORB again. This was after i got whipsawed but price did close about ORB on increasing volume so i took the trade and fully accepted risk. But again price reversed back into ORB. I set my stop a little more into ORB to not get whipsawed like last time but price ended up continuing into ORB and i got out. A little pissed that i could’ve had my TP on my earlier trade after taking the L on this one.
"May 21, 2025",SPY,PUT,Loss,SPY 587 PUT 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,1.50,1.26,-24,"May 21, 2025",This trade i should not have taken. I was emotional and wanted to test trading inside of ORB. My strategy is to take breaks outside of ORB. I only want to be trading inside of ORB if ORB is large and price is bouncing inside of it. I should have been more disciplined and waited for price to break outside of ORB. Had i done that my next trade would have been profitabled and covered my losses.
"May 21, 2025",SPY,PUT,Win,SPY 583 PUT 1DTE,5 Minute Chart,ORB,1.51,1.52,1,"May 21, 2025","Bad news was released and price completely tanked. It went straight through ORB. I was hesitant to take this trade because it was my fourth trade of the day and i felt a rush of adrenaline seeing price drop so sharp. I got in on the second candle out of ORB. This trade was well in profit so much that it covered all of my losses on the day but ended up reversing. I was tempted to just get out before i hit my TP but i thought that i should remain disciplined. Well price reversed which really upset me. Price then shopped around for about an hour at which point i decided i didn’t want to lose more money so i got out. As a look now price actually continued down after i got out…So i’m struggling with trying to remained discipline and deciding what the means. I think what would help most is if I am disciplined in all trades. Because when i am not it breaks my system and then i start second guessing and moving my stops. I was not supposed to stop out of this trade so early, but i was afraid to lose more money. Had i just been disciplined and not taken the 3rd trade earlier i wouldve have a great entry on this one and made money."

I saw the first breakout right as my meeting started but didnt take it since i wouldn’t have been able focus or close my trade in time. Price came down and retested ORB and I took the restest after a confirmation candle . I was patient, i accepted the risk and tried my best to not close out the trade early. I did end up closing out the trade early because it was a approching end of day, i was well in profit pretty close to my full TP but i saw price reversing. I decided to set my stop at the closest S/R level. I think this was a good idea to just lock in profits. Price ended up dumping the end of the day and i would’ve lost all of  my profit had i not gotten out. I think this might be something i toy with is setting my stops at S/R levels."
